Owl Lisp is being written mainly as a standalone pet project, but it
has gotten many useful bug reports, suggestions and patches during the
course of development. Here is a partial list of people who have helped
in the development:

   Doug Currie        GC improvements, data representation optimizations, etc.
   Jown Cowan         A slew of filed bugs.
   Pekka Pietikäinen  Portability suggestions and patches.
   Erno Kuusela       Portability suggestions and general insight.

The code similarly isn't based on any implementation or document, but 
many have definitely had an impact on it. A partial list of such sources 
follows:

   Recursive Programming Techniques, William H. Burge, 1975
   Essentials of Programming Languages, Friedman, Wand, Haynes, 1992
   Efficient Garbage Compaction Algorithm, Johannes Martin, 1982
   Scheme48, http://s48.org/ and various papers on it
   Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/
